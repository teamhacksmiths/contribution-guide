# Hacksmiths Mentoring Resources

## Style Guides
Here at Hacksmiths, we take writing good code very seriously.  We strictly follow the below style guides, in some cases with a few tweaks.  The main purpose of the Hacksmiths is to give us all an opportunity to grow our experience.  Thus, we will strive to implement best practices in all of our work in an effort to grow a reusable codebase that we are proud of.

### Git
Our Git style is a mashup of a few different philosophies. For one, we mostly follow the [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).  We follow a strict [Commit Message Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) written by Udacity.  Finally, for everything else, we follow this [Git Style Guide](https://github.com/jonathanong/git-style-guide).  

### Other
As our codebase grows, we will update our guides, adding our tools and configuration.  As we make decisions to implement new technologies, we will update this guide and commit our tools to the Hacksmiths github team account.

#### Documentation and Project Management
Our strategy for documentation will evolve over time.  It's recommended that we utilize agile, but our exact tools and processes are still being determined.

At the time of writing, we are utilizing Asana for Project Management and Ticketing, Google Documents for V1 specs and [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate), or another static site generator, to document our APIs. See the [Food Drivr Project](https://github.com/teamhacksmiths/food-drivr) and [API Reference](http://teamhacksmiths.github.io/food-drivr-api-documentation/) for a reference.
