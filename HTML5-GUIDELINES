## HTML5 Guidelines

In this project we are trying to keep our HTML semantic as meaningful as possible following the best HTML5 practices whenever we can.

Our goal is to avoid cluttering the DOM with `div`s over `div`s, although we know that sometimes it's not easy to make the right choice. If you surf the front-end community you will most certainly find many other people debating on the best use for specific tags.

In order to overcome this problem as much as we can, we provide a quick and very useful reference:
